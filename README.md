# Jim's Binance Bot 

This is a project that exposes a api that tries to see when volume for a coin is spiking up
and based on that give you a strength of recommendation to buy (and potentially at some point automatically buy).

## What's Here

This project was scaffolded with AWS CodeStar and includes these files:

* README.md - this file
* buildspec.yml - this file is used by AWS CodeBuild to package your
  service for deployment to AWS Lambda
* routes.js - this file contains the sample Node.js code for the web service
* index.js - this file contains the AWS Lambda handler code
* template.yml - this file contains the AWS Serverless Application Model (AWS SAM) used
  by AWS CloudFormation to deploy your service to AWS Lambda and Amazon API
  Gateway.
* tests/ - this directory contains unit tests for your application
* jims-binance-functions.js - This is the real meat of this project. It's basically a local
 wrapper that uses node-binance-api library to get data and then transforms it.


## Usage

To run your tests locally, go to the root directory of the
sample code and run the `npm test` command, which
AWS CodeBuild also runs through your `buildspec.yml` file.

To test your new code during the release process, modify the existing tests or
add tests to the tests directory. AWS CodeBuild will run the tests during the
build stage of your project pipeline. You can find the test results
in the AWS CodeBuild console.
